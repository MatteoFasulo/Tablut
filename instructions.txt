VM Link:

Code can be executed using the following command:

```bash
./runmyplayer.sh white 60 57.93.25.14
```

the sh script will run `python3 /home/tablut/tablut/play.py --team "$1" --timeout "$2" --ip "$3"` using argparse to parse the arguments.
Default name of the player is `\tLut` and default timeout is 60 seconds.
Team name is case insensitive and can be either `white` or `black` which then will be passed to the `--team` argument of the python script as uppercase.
